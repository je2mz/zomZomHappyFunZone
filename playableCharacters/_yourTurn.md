# Your Turn
  On your turn, you can take three actions total: `major`, `minor`, and `standard`.  You may sacrifice your `major` action to do an additional `minor` or `standard` action.

## Major
  A `major` action can be defined as drinking a potion or executing an action on your character sheet.  On your character sheet, you have two `cantrips` and two `abilities`.  

  You may use `cantrips` as many times as you want during an encounter, but only once per turn.

  You also have two `ability` points.  You may use two ability points per encounter and these points reset after an encounter is completed. You may spend both points on one spell, or spend one point for each.

## Minor
  A `minor` action can be defined as a small action such as standing up, unsheathing your sword, or picking up an item.  If you are unsure if the action you make is considered minor, the GM will make the final decision.

## Standard
  The `standard` action is your movement around the board.  Refer to your character sheet for your movement speed. The standard movement speed is 30 feet plus your mobility bonus. 5 Additional feet per point.
